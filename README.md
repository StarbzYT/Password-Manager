## About

This is a **Password Manager GUI** made with Python (_Tkinter module and SQLite3_) that allows the user to:

> - _**Add**_ a password for a specific website
> - _**Delete**_ their passwords
> - _**Update**_ their passwords
> - _**Clear**_ the input data

## Original Design

I decided to make a _design_ (**on Notability**) for the Password Manager before I dove right into the code. Although the final product looks different, this allowed me to visualize the _GUI_ while coding and streamlined the entire process!
