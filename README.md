# Password Manager

## **About**

This is a **Password Manager GUI** made with Python (_Tkinter module and SQLite3_) that allows the user to:

> - _**Add**_ a website and password for a specific website
> - _**Delete**_ their passwords and associated website
> - _**Update**_ their passwords and associated website
> - _**Clear**_ the input data

## **Original Design**

I decided to make a _design_ (**on Notability**) for the Password Manager before I dove right into the code. Although the final product looks different, this allowed me to visualize the _GUI_ while coding and streamlined the entire process!

## **The Result**

I changed a bit of the layout from the original design, but the functionality is the same as I intended it to be.

### **Potential improvements:**

> - Display data in the listbox in a more _accurate_ manner. (it's hard to tell what is what)
> - Make design more symmetrical. (also, add more styling)
> - Add RegEx to authenticate passwords
> - Recognize and handle duplicate data
